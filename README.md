# Udacity My Reads App

> This bookshelf app allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application.

## Installation

- Download or clone the project.
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

## Prerequisites

- npm
- Node.js

## App Functionality

> In this application, the main page displays a list of 'shelves' (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read
  > Each book has a control that lets you select the shelf for that book. When you select a different shelf, the books moves there. Note that the default value for the control should always be the current shelf the book is in.
  >
  > The main page also has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library. To keep the interface consistent, you may consider re-using some of the code you used to display the books on the main page.
